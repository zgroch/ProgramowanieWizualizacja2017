#' Creating, plotting and basic manipulation of fractals
#'
#' \code{IFSrainbow} allows you to plot nice and highly customisable
#' pictures of IFS fractals. See \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system}
#' for more information about IFS fractals.
#'
#' The only two functions that you are likely to use are \code{\link{createIFS}} (to
#' create an IFS fractal) and \code{\link{plot.IFS}} to plot it. We can also make you a GIF!
#' Moreover you may fancy adding
#' fractals with the use of an overloaded \code{\link{+.IFS}} operator.
