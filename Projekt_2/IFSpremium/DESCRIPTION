Description: The package IFSpremium allows creating objects of IFS class and plotting them. IFS fractals are fractals generated by systems of contractions (i.e. functions. with some specific properties). A list of most popular fractals (e.g. Sierpinski Triangle, Koch Curve) is included in the package so one can easily plot a fractal via plot() for objects of IFS class and enjoy its beauty.
